# Crash Team Racing - Godot

## Description
Godot version: 3.2.2 beta 3

This project has the objective to mimic crash team racing 1999 physics and kart handling.
I'll do my best to get as close as possible.

This is only possible with the help of CTR-Tools Guys which are decompiling the game
and have a lot of technical details about the game.
